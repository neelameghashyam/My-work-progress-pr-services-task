Today, I focused on key TypeScript concepts and prepared notes with examples for the following topics:

### TypeScript Concepts Covered:

- **Simple Types**: (e.g., `number`, `string`, `boolean`)
- **Special Types**: (`any`, `unknown`, `never`, `void`)
- **Arrays**: Defining arrays using type annotations (e.g., `number[]`, `Array<string>`)
- **Tuples**: Fixed-length arrays with specific types for each element
- **Object Types**: Custom object types with properties (e.g., `{ name: string; age: number; }`)
- **Enums**: Named constants that represent a set of values
- **Aliases & Interfaces**: Custom types with type aliases and `interface`
- **Union Types**: Combine multiple types with a single type definition
- **Functions**: Function types, optional parameters, and default values
- **Casting**: Type assertions using `as` and angle-bracket syntax
- **Classes**: Defining classes, inheritance, and access modifiers
- **Basic Generics**: Creating reusable components using generics
- **Utility Types**: Predefined types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, etc.
- **Keyof**: Using `keyof` to create type-safe access to object keys
- **Null**: Handling `null` and `undefined` in TypeScript
- **Definitely Typed**: Usage of third-party type definitions

Today, I completed **TypeScript** tutorial that given. Alongside that, I explored **Angular** to better understand its purpose and grasped its **folder structure**, which is crucial for developing applications. I also took the time to note down some important insights and key points for future reference.
